# Checking gemomic locations of differentially expressed transcripts

We have a list of differentially expressed transcripts and we want to know where in the XL genome they are, and also what their annotations are.

In this directory on graham, I have set up databases of the XL genome seq, the XL transcriptome seqs, and the human transcriptome seqs, respectively:
```
/home/ben/projects/rrg-ben/for_Sam/2021_XL_v10_refgenome
/home/ben/projects/rrg-ben/for_Sam/2025_XL_transcriptome
/home/ben/projects/rrg-ben/for_Sam/human_transcriptome
```

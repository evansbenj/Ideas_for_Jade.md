# Annotating contigs

I am using XL CDS to annotate contigs in allo. I made a fasta file of all CDS from XL here:
```
/home/ben/projects/rrg-ben/ben/2021_XL_v10_refgenome/XL_CDS_only.fasta
```

And I can use this as a query to blast individual contigs. First I need to make a blast db of the contig of interest (I'm going to do this for 7 contigs that map to Chr7L):
```

```
